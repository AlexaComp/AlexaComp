<h1 align="center">AlexaComp Privacy Policy</h1>

AlexaComp collects only a very minimal amount of information about users and their requests to the Alexa devices.

<pre>
<b>Bottom Line:</b>
    Things I <u>CAN</u> see:
        - Anonymized Process Logs from the AWS Lambda Servers.
        - Pairs of IPv4 Addresses, and Alexa Device IDs. (I can not tell who that device or IP belongs to.)
        - Your email address is visible to the skill model, but I do not log the 
          address, and it is only retrreived when you start the device linking process.
          For more information on device linking, <a href="https://github.com/akmadian/AlexaComp/blob/docs/Docs/Setup.md">see more information about device linking here.</a>
    Things I <u>CAN NOT</u> see:
        - Your Name or Home Address.
        - The Files on Your Computer.
        - I Can Not Hear Anything You Say Before You Start an AlexaComp Request,
          I Can Not Hear Anything You Say After You Finish an AlexaComp Request.
</pre>

I will never sell any of your data.

All traffic between AlexaComp services is (or will be very soon) encrypted with AES-256 bit encryption.

No more infomation is collected than is needed for operation of the skill, and basic debugging.
