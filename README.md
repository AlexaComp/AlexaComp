## Installation
The skill is not available yet, but an installer for the client-side software is. The skill model is going through the certification process.

One of my goals is to have nearly zero user driven configuration. The only thing the user must take part in configuring is linking their Alexa device to their computer's public IP. Instructions for setup will be made when the feature is working.

## Account Linking
Q: Why do I need to link my Amazon account to use AlexaComp?<br/>
A: Account linking is used only to get the user's email address. The email is only retreived and used when the user tells AlexaComp to start device linking.

## Planned Features
#### Launching various applications <br/>
ex. "Alexa, tell my computer to launch google chrome"

#### Retrieving Hardware Info <br/>
ex. "Alexa, ask my computer what my gpu temp is"

#### Issuing System Commands <br/>
ex. "Alexa, tell my computer to shut down"
